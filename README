Feathers Enterprise SDK
=======================

The Feathers Enterprise SDK is a fork of the Apache Flex SDK that adds
first-class support for Starling and Feathers to the MXML compiler.

Warning: This is a pre-release version of the Feathers Enterprise SDK. It will
contain bugs or unfinished features. It is even close to being useful for
production apps at this time. It is considered extremely *unstable*. Use at your
own risk.
