Feathers Enterprise SDK
=======================

The Feathers Enterprise SDK is a fork of the Apache Flex SDK that adds
first-class support for Starling and Feathers to the MXML compiler.

Warning: This is a pre-release version of the Feathers Enterprise SDK. It
contains bugs and unfinished features. It is not even remotely close to being
useful for production apps at this time. It is considered extremely *unstable*.
Use at your own risk.
