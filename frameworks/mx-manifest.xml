<!--
	In IntelliJ IDEA, when the component set is set to "Spark + MX" or
	"MX Only", an error will be thrown if mx-manifest.xml is missing. It's
	better to keep this file here than to confuse people. Errors that require
	developers to get the project settings right when the settings have nothing
	to do with Feathers is a bad idea.
